Rarebit is a protocol used to record and transfer digital collectibles (digital assets) on bitcoin's blockchain.

Rarebit works by associating the hash of a digital file with a small amount of bitcoin value. This value can be transferred indefinitely while remaining provably bound to the content it represents and to the author that issued it.

Project site includes a client app that runs in the browser. Loads, hashes, issues and transfers digital works (beta 3.1, 2015.7.1).
